<b>#Gotta Dodge'em All</b>
<br>
I have built a simple yet functional game using HTML,CSS and vanilla JS
<br>
<b>The game's logic is as follows :</b><br>
The aim is to dodge the incoming obstacles by arrow keys and for each obstacle you dodge, a point is earned. When your car crashes into an obstacle the game is over and the user has the options to either 
go back to home screen ,reset the game or store his/her points in localstorage<br>
As this was my first time using animations and sound effects in a project, therefore i tried my best and has also provided bg music on/off option.<br>
Alongwith, a tutorial is also provided at the start of the game for the first time players<br>
I plan to add much better animations like changing the image of the car to a broken one upon collision, have a better and pleasing UI and most importantly,<b> make it compatible for all screen sizes.</b><br>
Hope you have a great expirience! (i would currently recommend to play the game on full desktop screen and open console to to see records)<br>
